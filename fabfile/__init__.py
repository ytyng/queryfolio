"""Fabric tasks for QueryFolio (Fabric3 / Fabric 1.x API).

Run `fab -l` to list tasks.

The release build (macOS dmg + Windows NSIS installer) runs on GitHub Actions and
is triggered manually from here with `fab release` (the Actions workflow is
workflow_dispatch only). That task just wraps `pnpm release`, which bumps the
version, pushes it to main, dispatches the workflow, and follows the run.
