# Settings

QueryFolio is configured through a single YAML file. This page explains where that
file lives and every key it accepts.

For a ready-to-copy starting point, see [`config.example.yaml`](../config.example.yaml)
in the repository root.

## File location

The config file lives at:

```
~/.config/queryfolio/config.yml
```

`config.yaml` (the `.yaml` spelling) is also accepted; `config.yml` takes
precedence when both exist. On first launch, if neither file is present,
QueryFolio creates a starter `config.yml` for you.

Because the file can contain plaintext passwords and other secrets, QueryFolio
writes it with `0600` permissions (owner read/write only) on macOS/Linux. If an
existing file has looser permissions, they are tightened to `0600` on load and on
save. (On Windows, the platform's default file permissions apply.)

## Editing the config

You can edit the file with any text editor, or from inside the app:

- Menu bar **QueryFolio → Edit config.yml** opens a built-in editor (with YAML
  syntax highlighting and lint errors shown inline).
- Saving from the in-app editor validates that the content still parses as a YAML
  mapping, writes it atomically, and reloads all connections.

After editing the file directly, reload connections (reopen the app or use the
menu) to pick up the changes.

## Connections (`sql_servers`)

`sql_servers` is a **list** of connection definitions. This format is compatible
with `sql-agent-mcp-server`. Writing a mapping here (instead of a list) is an
error.

```yaml
sql_servers:
  - name: dev-postgres
    description: "Development PostgreSQL"
    engine: postgres
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    schema: development_db
    user: dev_user
    password: your_password_here
```

### Common keys

| Key | Required | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `name` | yes | Display name shown in the connections list. |
| `engine` | yes | `postgres` (aliases: `postgresql`), `mysql` (aliases: `mariadb`), or `sqlite` (aliases: `sqlite3`). |
| `description` | no | Free-text note shown in the UI. |
| `host` | no | Database host. Defaults to `localhost` when omitted. Not needed for SQLite. When using an SSH tunnel, this is the DB host **as seen from the SSH endpoint** (often `localhost`). |
| `port` | no | Database port. Defaults per engine when omitted: `5432` (PostgreSQL) / `3306` (MySQL). |
| `schema` | depends | The database / schema to connect to. For SQLite, this is the **path to the database file** (queryfolio extension; `~` is expanded; if `schema` is omitted, `host` is used as the file path instead). |
| `user` | no | Database user. |
| `password` | no | Database password. |
| `readonly` | no | See [Safety guards](#safety-guards). Default `false`. |
| `allow_dangerous_statements` | no | See [Safety guards](#safety-guards). Default `false`. |
| `folder_name` | no | Override the query-file folder name. See [Query file storage](#query-file-storage-sqlfiles_dir-folder_name). |
| `ssh_tunnel` | no | Connect through an SSH tunnel. See [SSH tunnels](#ssh-tunnels-ssh_tunnel). |
| `template` | no | Inherit keys from a named template. See [Connection templates](#connection-templates). |

### Engines

- **PostgreSQL** — `engine: postgres`. Standard host / port / schema / user /
  password.
- **MySQL / MariaDB** — `engine: mysql`. Standard host / port / schema / user /
  password.
- **SQLite** — `engine: sqlite`. Put the **file path** in `schema` (queryfolio
  extension; if `schema` is omitted, `host` is used as the file path instead).
  `port` / `user` / `password` are not used.

  ```yaml
  - name: local-sqlite
    engine: sqlite
    schema: ~/data/example.sqlite3
  ```

### Safety guards

Two per-connection flags help prevent accidents. They are independent of the
toolbar **Writable** switch (which is off by default each session and only lets
side-effect-free statements run until you turn it on).

- **`readonly: true`** — rejects write statements (INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE /
  DDL, CTE-wrapped DML, `SELECT INTO`, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` of a DML, an assignment
  `PRAGMA` like `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL`, etc.). The check is keyword-based:
  statements whose leading keyword is `SELECT` / `WITH` / `SHOW` / `DESCRIBE` /
  `DESC` / `EXPLAIN` / `VALUES` / `TABLE` / `CALL` / (non-assignment) `PRAGMA`,
  plus meta commands, are allowed. This is a guard, not a sandbox — it does **not** stop
  every side effect: a `CALL` to a stored procedure that writes, a SELECT that
  calls a side-effecting function (e.g. `nextval`), or a parenthesized settings
  `PRAGMA` are not blocked. A `readonly` connection shows a lock in the UI and
  cannot be unlocked with the Writable switch.

  ```yaml
  - name: production-replica
    engine: mysql
    host: replica.example.com
    schema: production_db
    user: replica_user
    password: replica_password
    readonly: true
  ```

- **`allow_dangerous_statements: true`** — by default (`false`), statements that
  can destroy a lot of data at once — `UPDATE` / `DELETE` with no `WHERE`, and
  `DROP` / `TRUNCATE` — are rejected. Set this to `true` to allow them; the app
  still shows a confirmation dialog before running such a statement. `readonly`
  is evaluated first, so a `readonly` connection never reaches this guard.

  The `WHERE` check is a simple word scan (after stripping literals and
  comments), so it is deliberately conservative: an `UPDATE` / `DELETE` whose
  only `WHERE` is inside a sub-query or an unrelated CTE is treated as "has a
  `WHERE`" and allowed through. It reliably catches the typical `WHERE`-less
  form; it is not a full parser.

  ```yaml
  - name: dev-db
    engine: postgres
    host: localhost
    schema: dev
    user: dev_user
    password: dev_password
    allow_dangerous_statements: true
  ```

### SSH tunnels (`ssh_tunnel`)

Add an `ssh_tunnel` block to connect through an SSH local port forward. There are
two modes.

**1. Built-in tunnel (libssh2).** Give it the SSH host / user and one of:
password, private key, or (by default) the SSH agent.

```yaml
- name: remote-db-with-ssh
  engine: postgres
  host: localhost      # DB host as seen from the SSH endpoint
  port: 5432
  schema: remote_db
  user: remote_user
  password: remote_password
  ssh_tunnel:
    host: ssh.example.com
    port: 22
    user: ssh_user
    # Pick ONE auth method:
    # password: ssh_password
    private_key_path: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    # private_key_passphrase: key_passphrase
    # When no password/private_key_path is set, the SSH agent is used.
    # identity_agent: ~/Library/Group Containers/2BUA8C4S2C.com.1password/t/agent.sock
```

`ssh_tunnel` keys (built-in mode):

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `host` | SSH host to connect to. |
| `port` | SSH port (default `22`). |
| `user` | SSH user. |
| `password` | SSH password (optional). |
| `private_key_path` | Path to a private key (optional; `~` expanded). |
| `private_key_passphrase` | Passphrase for the private key (optional). |
| `identity_agent` | ssh-agent socket to use (queryfolio extension, like OpenSSH's `IdentityAgent`). Use `none` to disable the agent. When omitted, it is resolved from `~/.ssh/config` (`IdentityAgent`) and then `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`. Useful when the app is launched from Finder/Dock and does not inherit the right socket (e.g. the 1Password SSH agent). |

**2. Delegate to the system `ssh` client (`ssh_config`).** Set `ssh_config` to a
`Host` alias from your `~/.ssh/config`. QueryFolio then runs the system `ssh`
client (`ssh -N -L`) instead of libssh2, so **ProxyJump / multi-hop tunnels** and
full `HostName` / `User` / `Port` resolution are handled by OpenSSH.

```yaml
- name: remote-db-via-ssh-config
  engine: postgres
  host: localhost      # DB host as seen from the final SSH host
  port: 5432
  schema: remote_db
  user: remote_user
  password: remote_password
  ssh_tunnel:
    ssh_config: pop-three-ec2-staging
```

With a `~/.ssh/config` like:

```
Host pop-three-ec2-staging
    HostName 172.21.122.39
    User torico
    ProxyJump pop-three-bastion
```

naming the alias is enough. In this mode the built-in-mode keys (`host` / `user`
/ `password` / `private_key_*` / `identity_agent`) are **ignored** — authentication
and host-key checking are done entirely by OpenSSH (`BatchMode=yes`, so an unknown
host key or a passphrase prompt fails instead of blocking; agent auth still
works).

## Connection groups

Wrap servers in a `group_name` + nested `sql_servers` entry to show them under a
group heading in the connections list (queryfolio extension). Grouped and plain
(ungrouped) servers can be mixed; the display order follows the config order.
Groups cannot be nested (a group inside a group is an error), and a group entry
may only contain `group_name` and `sql_servers`.

```yaml
sql_servers:
  - group_name: production
    sql_servers:
      - name: prod-main
        engine: mysql
        host: prod.example.com
        # ...
      - name: prod-replica
        engine: mysql
        host: replica.example.com
        # ...
  - name: ungrouped-db          # plain servers can be mixed in
    engine: sqlite
    schema: ~/data/example.sqlite3
```

Templates (see below) still work inside a group.

## Connection templates

Define reusable defaults under `sql_server_templates`, then reference one with
`template: <name>` on a server. Keys set on the server override the same key in
the template (shallow merge).

```yaml
sql_server_templates:
  - name: my-awesome-sql-host
    engine: mysql
    host: db.example.com
    port: 3306
    user: shared_user
    password: shared_password

sql_servers:
  - name: reporting
    template: my-awesome-sql-host
    schema: reporting_db      # host/port/user/password inherited
```

## Overriding config from an external source (`config_override_command`)

`config_override_command` runs a command whose **stdout is YAML**, and merges
that YAML over your file. This lets you keep secrets (API keys, passwords, whole
connection lists) in a secrets manager like 1Password instead of in plaintext.

```yaml
config_override_command: op read "op://development/queryfolio/config-yaml"
```

Merge rules (`config.rs > merge_mapping`):

- **Mappings are merged recursively** — e.g. you can override just `ai.api_key`
  and keep the local `ai.model`.
- **Scalars and lists (including `sql_servers`) are replaced wholesale** — lists
  are not merged element-by-element, because there is no reliable element
  identity.
- **Any key** can be overridden this way, not just `sql_servers`.

Notes:

- A `config_override_command` inside the fetched YAML is **not** followed
  recursively; the key is dropped after merging.
- The command runs **without a shell** (arguments are split with shlex, so pipes
  and redirects do not work). The minimal GUI `PATH` is supplemented with
  `/opt/homebrew/bin` and `/usr/local/bin`. It has a 60-second timeout.
- The merged config is cached once per session (the getter can take a few seconds
  plus Touch ID), and cleared on reload.
- If the key exists but is not a non-empty string, that is an error (QueryFolio
  will not silently fall back to the local-only config).
- Menu bar **QueryFolio → View override config yaml (Copy only)** appears when
  this key is set. It runs the command every time and shows the fetched YAML for
  inspection/copying. You can edit the text in the modal (handy for reformatting
  before copying it into 1Password), but those edits stay in memory only — there
  is no Save, so the changes are never written back.

## AI features (`ai`)

Configure natural-language → SQL generation and related AI helpers. The `ai`
section can live at the top level of the local config **or** in the YAML fetched
by `config_override_command`. When both exist, the fetched YAML wins (so the API
key can stay in 1Password). Because `ai` is a mapping, it is merged recursively —
putting just `api_key` in the fetched YAML keeps your local `model`.

```yaml
ai:
  provider: openai   # only "openai" is supported for now
  api_key: sk-your-api-key
  model: gpt-5.1                        # optional (default: gpt-5.1)
  base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1   # optional (for OpenAI-compatible APIs)
```

| Key | Required | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `provider` | no | Currently only `openai` (default). An unknown value is an error. |
| `api_key` | yes | The API key. It is not exposed through the app's AI status (which reports only whether AI is `configured` and the `model`), though the in-app config editor naturally shows the whole file, including this key. |
| `model` | no | Model name (default `gpt-5.1`). |
| `base_url` | no | Base URL for OpenAI-compatible APIs (default `https://api.openai.com/v1`). |

What is sent to the AI: the schema (table / column names), the engine dialect,
your statements, your natural-language instructions, query plans (for EXPLAIN
analysis), and — for the "Fix with AI" helper — the **database error message** of
the failed statement. Query result rows are never sent. Note that a database error
message can itself embed data values (for example, a unique-constraint violation
often includes the conflicting key value), so it is not strictly free of row data.
Generated SQL is inserted into the editor, never auto-executed.

## Auto `LIMIT` (`default_limit`)

`default_limit` appends `LIMIT n` to `SELECT` statements that do not already have
one, to avoid accidentally fetching huge result sets.

```yaml
default_limit: 500   # default: 500; set 0 to disable
```

Sub-query `LIMIT`s, `FOR UPDATE`, and similar cases are skipped conservatively.

## Query file storage (`sqlfiles_dir`, `folder_name`)

QueryFolio auto-saves per-connection query files as
`<sqlfiles_dir>/<folder>/<name>.sql`.

```yaml
sqlfiles_dir: ~/queries   # default: ~/.config/queryfolio/sqlfiles
```

The `<folder>` name is chosen per connection:

- If the server sets `folder_name`, that is used.
- Otherwise it is built as `<host>_<engine>_<schema>_<user>` (the connection
  `name` is **not** used; path separators are sanitized).

For example, the `dev-postgres` connection above resolves to
`localhost_postgres_development_db_dev_user`. Set `folder_name` to pin the folder
so it does not move when you change `host`/`schema`/etc.:

```yaml
- name: dev-postgres
  folder_name: dev-pg
  engine: postgres
  # ...
```

> If you rename a connection's folder (or change the fields it is derived from),
> existing query files stay in the old folder.

Each folder also gets an auto-generated `_queryfolio.md` describing the connection
(non-secret info only). It is not a `.sql` file, so it never shows up in the
file list or search.

## Environment variable override (`QUERYFOLIO_CONFIG_YAML`)

Setting the `QUERYFOLIO_CONFIG_YAML` environment variable replaces the **entire**
config file with the variable's contents. This is a development / testing hook
(GUI apps launched from Finder/Dock do not inherit shell environment variables,
so this mainly applies when launching from a terminal). While it is set, the
in-app config editor has no file to write and returns an error.

## Full example

See [`config.example.yaml`](../config.example.yaml) for a complete, annotated
example covering every key above.
